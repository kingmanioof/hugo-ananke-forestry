The Kingman Odd Fellows organization donated $500 to the Kingman Cancer Care Unit on Dec. 19, 2020. Presenting was Lodge Treasurer Cecelia Curtis and Lodge Secretary Mary Smith. Receiving was KCCU President Claire Crum, KCCU Vice President Doris Plank and KCCU staff. Kingman Odd Fellows Lodge No. 8 was chartered in 2019 by the Grand Lodge of Arizona, but the history of the Odd Fellows in Kingman goes back more than 100 years. From nine members at the 2019 reopening, Kingmanâ€™s lodge has grown to 20 who work to improve and uplift the community. Recent outreach includes seasonal raffles, giving for the relief of the sick and distressed, and attempts to preserve or improve local monuments. Those interested in working with fellow community members in a positive and orderly manner are encouraged to approach the lodge for membership. Lodge meetings are held at 10 a.m. on the first and third Saturdays of each month at 2985 E. John L Ave.
