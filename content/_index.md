Welcome to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows!

We are an organization dedicated to elevating mankind, morally, intellectually, socially, and physically, while recognizing man's individual helplessness and great need of co-operation in all the affairs of life. Our order requires its members to aid, assist, and protect each other, to visit the sick, relieve the distressed, bury the dead, and protect the widow and orphan. It teaches the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; it strives to break down the artificial barriers that separate man from his fellow man, and places all upon an equality, as members of one great family.

Lodge is held every first and third Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at 212 N. 4th St., Kingman, AZ 86401.
